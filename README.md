### Hello!

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of York, currently on a placement year at [ETAS](https://www.etas.com/en/) working on [EHOOKS](https://www.etas.com/en/products/ehooks.php), and also the Press and Publicity Officer for [HackSoc](https://hacksoc.org).

### Development

I mainly write code in Ruby! My favourite projects to work on are often developer tools, such as the [Parlour plugin framework](https://github.com/AaronC81/parlour) I created for the [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org) type checker.

Right now I'm learning Rust, as well as trying to get better at electronics and embedded development.
