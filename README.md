### Hello!

I'm a Software Engineer at [ETAS](https://www.etas.com/en/), working on [EHOOKS](https://www.etas.com/en/products/ehooks.php).

In my free time I create some side-projects, mainly in Ruby or Rust. Many of these are developer tools, such as the [Parlour plugin framework](https://github.com/AaronC81/parlour) I created for the [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org) type checker.

I also enjoy electronics and embedded development, with my [Delta Pico graphing calculator](https://github.com/AaronC81/delta-pico) being a particular favourite.
